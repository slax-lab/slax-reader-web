### üìú Contributor Agreement

**Important Note:** Your Pull Request submissions may be merged or incorporated into our commercial version. Before submitting a PR, you need to sign our Contributor Informed Consent Form.

We use [CLA Assistant](https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant) Bot to manage this process. When you submit your first PR, the CLA Assistant Bot will automatically add a link in the PR comments, guiding you through the signing process. You only need to click the link and follow the prompts to complete the signing. This process only needs to be completed once during your first contribution.

After the signing process is complete, the Bot will automatically update your PR status, indicating that you have agreed to our terms. Please note that PRs without a signed consent form cannot be merged.

## üé® Code Style

Our project follows these coding standards:

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles**

   - Organize code into domain models, repositories, services, and application layers
   - Use clear bounded contexts to separate different business domains

2. **Dependency Injection**

   - Leverage dependency injection to reduce coupling between components
   - Avoid singletons and static methods in favor of testable designs

3. **Project Layering**
   - Follow a clear layered architecture: presentation layer, application layer, domain layer, and infrastructure layer
   - Ensure dependencies between layers flow in one direction

Please ensure your code adheres to these guidelines to maintain consistency and maintainability in our codebase.

## üß™ Testing

Ensure your changes are covered by tests (where applicable). Run existing tests to make sure everything works as expected.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct
